Gripping Olivia tighter to you, you felt as if you were being shunted up some kind of tube of sorts, forcibly being pushed and pulled in a certain direction, all while everything was visible to you as you saw an almost odd tunnel take shape around you.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://cdn6.fiction.live/file/fictionlive/images/1e8a7hnvl_Tunnel_to_Heaven.jpg"></figure><p></p><p><b>"The Thread I've woven for this gateway...something is entangling it. Something...no Someone is disrupting the weave, altering it for some reason, even I-"</b> comes a voice from all around you, speaking in a feminine, yet commanding manner.</p><p>Remembering those first trials you and Olivia had undertaken oh so long ago, you can now place a name to the voice. It was Neith, the one who was orchestrating these trials in the first place. So to hear her seemingly being surprised by this, with this being something even she was not expecting, you couldn't help but hold Olivia tighter to you as a result.</p><h2><b>"ℑ 𝔞𝔪 𝔄𝔩𝔭𝔥𝔞 𝔞𝔫𝔡 𝔒𝔪𝔢𝔤𝔞, 𝔱𝔥𝔢 𝔟𝔢𝔤𝔦𝔫𝔫𝔦𝔫𝔤 𝔞𝔫𝔡 𝔱𝔥𝔢 𝔢𝔫𝔡𝔦𝔫𝔤." </b></h2><p>Boomed an imperious voice, one that seemed to resonate within you to your very core.</p><p><b>"It's...it's Him. But...but we all thought...no...the weave, the one that was supposed to send you to the future challenge, it has been altered, I don't know-" </b>came Neith's voice once again, though this time you note that she appears nervous.</p><h2><b>"𝔖𝔞𝔩𝔳𝔞𝔱𝔦𝔬𝔫 𝔪𝔲𝔰𝔱 𝔟𝔢 𝔯𝔢𝔰𝔱𝔬𝔯𝔢𝔡,T̷̢̨̟̦̃̒̌̓̆̈́̽̕h̸̪̪̩͕̬̥͕̖͙̮̃͆ȩ̵̱͙̼̅̐̅̌͌͗̌ ̴͕̖͚̦̝̝̬͚͎̠̅͋͐̏͛͗͆̅Ê̵̛͈͊n̴̢̤̦͙̭̣͔̅̓̊̆̽͒̈́̎͆͜d̴̻̭̫̣̹̬̬̋̇́͊͆͗͠͝ 𝔪𝔲𝔰𝔱 𝔟𝔢 𝔞𝔳𝔢𝔯𝔱𝔢𝔡."</b></h2><p><br></p><p>You had no idea what was happening right now, all you could feel was if someone was pounding words, ideas, even visions into your head. For brief flashes at a time, you saw golden light, malefic fire, and the unending void interspersed between the sounds of blaring trumpets, the cacophany of battle, and the bestial roar of a beast which shook you even to its core.</p><h2><b>"𝔄 ℌ𝔢𝔯𝔞𝔩𝔡 𝔥𝔞𝔰 𝔠𝔬𝔪𝔢.

As the words are spoken, you can feel an end coming, a final destination about to be reached. All the while, you steel yourself, for someone who could seemingly just hijack the threads of Neith, a Goddess who could casually allow you to time travel through the weave of the world, they were not someone who could easily be trifled with.</p><h2><b>"𝔄𝔩𝔩 𝔰𝔱𝔬𝔯𝔦𝔢𝔰 𝔥𝔞𝔳𝔢 𝔞 𝔟𝔢𝔤𝔦𝔫𝔫𝔦𝔫𝔤 𝔞𝔫𝔡 𝔞𝔫 𝔢𝔫𝔡.
